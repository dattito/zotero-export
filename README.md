# zotero-export

This is a small CLI tool that allows downloading the items (mostly for the biblatex format) of a collection and storing it in a file.
It uses the cloud access of zotero, not the local application.

ToDo:
- Better error handling
- Extended functionality

Feel free to open pull requests for these ToDos when interested.
